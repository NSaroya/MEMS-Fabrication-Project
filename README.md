# Objective
The project aimed to fabricate and test a variety of *micro-electro-mechanical systems* (MEMS) using standard fabrication and characterization techniques. These include simple spring and beam structures, small drives, extended-needle gauges, large drives, resistance gauges, inch-worm gears, smooth movers and many more. The main fabrication techniques used in this lab are photolithography, anisotropic etch of Si using the Bosch process in the RIE system and etching of the SOI layer by VHF etching. 

Among various fabricated structures, the comb drive is a basic building block which is one of the various methods used to actuate MEMS devices. A Comb drive consists of a series of interdigitated teeth. Comb drives actuate by utilizing the electrostatic force generated by the oppositely charged comb teeth in the drive to move one set of teeth relative to the 
other. While comb teeth must overlap to initiate the attraction, a large overlap is undesirable because this will restrict the range of motion of the combs. The anchored spring suspensions provide the restoring force for the movable combs to return to their original positions. Since the device is planar, the springs and the linear motion occur in the same plane.

# Introduction
## MEMS
The origin of the field of MEMS is largely attributed to physicist Richard P. Feynman who presented, in 1959 to the American Physical Society, his visionary speech entitled “There’s plenty of room at the bottom”. Since then, great strides have been made in miniaturisation technologies and techniques that have allowed the fabrication of MEMS to be possible.

MEMS refer to devices that have a characteristic length between 1 µm and 1 mm and integrate electrical and mechanical components. The field of MEMS is known by a variety of other names: micromechanics, microsystems technology (MST), micro-machines, microactuators. The study of MEMS is a rapidly emerging field that plays an important role in the microelectronics industry. MEMS fill a vital niche by creating devices that would be too large and costly or even impossible to make using traditional integrated circuit (IC) electronics: devices such as optical switches and relays.

MEMS are traditionally fabricated onto a substrate or wafer that may also contain the electronics required to interact with the MEMS device. One type of substrate is the *silicon-on-insulator* (SOI) wafer. SOI MEMS are planar devices that consist of three layers: a top Si *device layer*, a middle SiO2 layer, and a bottom silicon base layer. After processing, sections of the Si device layer hover over the silicon base layer, allowing for movement; this is accomplished by removing portions of the SiO2, which we deem a *sacrificial layer*. The SiO2 that has not been removed anchors immobile sections of the device layer to the silicon base layer. One type of MEMS device is a *comb drive*, which uses electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged combs to mechanically actuate the device

## SOI Wafer
Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers consist of three layers: a 20 µm Si device layer, a 2 µm buried-oxide (BOX) SiO2 sacrificial layer, and a ∼500 µm Si handle wafer. The thickness of these layers varies depending on the devices being fabricated. The Si device layer is patterned and etched to create MEMS devices, while parts of the sacrificial SiO2 layer are etched using buffered oxide etch (BOE) to release the MEMS for actuation. The unetched SiO2 anchors the MEMS to the handle wafer, providing electrical isolation for the two silicon layers. Different methods are used to produce SOI wafers, including SIMOX, wafer bonding, Smart Cut, NanoCleave, and ELTRAN, which involve processes like ion implantation and controlled exfoliation. SOI wafers offer advantages such as reduced power consumption, increased speed, and improved manufacturing processes, making them valuable in MEMS and CMOS integrated circuit fabrications.
